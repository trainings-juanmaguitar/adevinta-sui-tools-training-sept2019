### Remain work

- We're using now the config of the domain as a way to supply the lack of global state, so we have to create a new instance of the domain for each request. Is that the best we could do in order to achieve that? Is that having an impact to the performance of our website? Could we extract the config from the domain to at least have a external package with a shared API among all the sites?
- Create a test framework for our domains and create a guide about how to do testing.
